# Project Title: Interactive Math & String Utility Program

## Project Description:
This project is a C++ console application. It presents an interactive menu-driven system that allows users to perform various mathematical and string manipulation tasks. The program continuously prompts the user for input until they explicitly choose the option to exit.

## Features:
The program offers the following functionalities through a text-based menu:
1.  **Factorial Calculator**: Calculates the factorial of a user-provided positive integer.
2.  **Number Pyramid**: Generates and displays a number pyramid pattern of a specified height.
3.  **Sum of Even or Odd Numbers:** Computes the sum of either even or odd numbers up to a user-defined limit.
4.  **Reverse a String:** Takes a string input from the user and displays its reversed version.
5.  **Exit Program:** Allows the user to terminate the application gracefully.

## How to Compile and Run (GitHub CodeSpaces):
1.  **Open in CodeSpaces**: Launch this repository in a GitHub CodeSpace environment.
2.  **Access the Terminal**: Open a terminal window within CodeSpaces.
3.  **Compile the Code**: Use the g++ compiler (or any other C++ compiler) to build the executable. The source file is named "loops_project.cpp".
4.  **Run the Executable**: Execute the compiled program from the terminal.
5.  **Interact with the Menu**: Follow the on-screen prompts to select and use the different utility functions. Choose the "Exit" option to stop the program.
